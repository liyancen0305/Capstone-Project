Summarize the most important steps you took in cleaning up your data

Based on the data I collected for two cities on house price index¡±, "Population trend", "Demographics", and ¡°unemployment rate¡±, I used several functions to make the datasets more readable.

I created a list for all the functions I use to clean the datasets.

1. To rename the "Date" into "Year" by using "names()"

names(LA_Unemployment_Original)[1] <- "Year"

2. To only have the first quarter of every year by using "endsWith()"
a <- endsWith(as.character(LA_Unemployment_Original$Year), "£¯1£¯1")  # Which rows to keep (kp)?
      LA_Unemployment_Clean <- LA_Unemployment_Original[a, ]

3. To format the year, and make it more readable. Ex: "19/1/1" to "2019" by usring "year()"
LA_Unemployment_Clean$Year <- year(as.Date(LA_Unemployment_Clean$Year, "%y"))
      Round_Rock_Unemployment_Clean$Year <- year(as.Date(Round_Rock_Unemployment_Clean$Year, "%y"))

4. To combine two dataset together by using "cbind()"
Unemployment <- cbind(LA_Unemployment_Clean, Round_Rock_Unemployment_Clean[,2])

5. To delete useless columns by using "NULL"
LA_Demographics_Original$X.1 <- NULL
