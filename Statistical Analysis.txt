* Unemployment rate

The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all 
individuals currently in the labor force. By comparing with two 
cities, we can see that both unemployment rate are decreasing, with Los Angeles decreasing in a more stable condition, but Roud Rock's decreasing curve is sharper,
which means there is a more obvious decreasing in unemployment rate in Round Rock.

During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate. According to their data, and line graph, both cities have their
highest unemployment rates in 2011. We can see that both cities' economy has been hurt dramaticlly due to 2008 depression. Comparatively speaking, Round Rock was 
recoverd sooner than Los Angeles County


* Population Trend

According to both of the datasets, we can see that both populations are increasing, while Round Rock's trend is steadier.
The population grouth in Los Angeles is getting more slower that Round Rock, which means that Los Angeles county is a pretty developed city where growth potential 
has been limited.
On the other side, Population in Round Rock is growing over the the years. Compared with Los Angeles country, Round Rock is far from developed, it is still growing.


* House Price Index

The HPI is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. The HPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes
in repeat sales or refinancings on the same properties. In other words, it means that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancing on the same 
properties.

Based on the datasets, we can see the both HPIs are on an increasing trend while Round Rock has a higher HPI.
